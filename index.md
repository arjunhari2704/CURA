**CURA**

Cura is a 3D printer slicing application. It was created by David Braam; he was later employed by Ultimaker to maintain the software. Cura has been released under the open source Affero General Public License version 3. Development is hosted on GitHub. Cura is the preferred slicer software for Ultimaker 3D printers, but can be used with other printers as well
